# Summary
This is a CPU-version path-tracer rendering photorealistic images. I mainly focus on how to generate physically plausible images, the ray-tracing part will be done by Intel's "Embree" library.

## Refraction
The refraction is also implemented so that a glass ball that correctly refracts its surroundings is seen.
